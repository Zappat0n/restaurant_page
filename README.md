# My Little Tavern
This is a sample restaurant web page developed in different javascript modules. I am using Webpack to create a div folder with all the content ready for production.


## About the Project

![Top Page Screenshot](./src/assets/screenshot.png)

The original specification of the project is from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/restaurant-page).

The web page consists of a tab with three different types of content:
 - Restaurant
 - Contact
 - Menu

There you can see updated information about the restaurant.
